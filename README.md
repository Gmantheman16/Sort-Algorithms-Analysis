# Sort Algorithms Analysis

## Description

- This project was created to empirically test 3 common sort algorithms, QuickSort, MergeSort, and HeapSort
- Since algorithms are commonly observed theoretically, my motivation for creating this project was to show the differences of these algorithms with concrete numbers
- To test these sort algorithms empirically, they are each tested with unsorted, sorted, and reverse-sorted data. Each type of data includes 30 small samples (10,000 integers), 30 medium samples (100,000 integers), and 30 large samples (1,000,000 integers)

## Installation

To install this code, follow these steps:
1. Create a new empty project in your preferred IDE
2. Copy and paste this command into your command line to clone the repository into your project:
##
        git clone https://github.com/gg47633/Sort-Algorithms-Analysis.git
3. Now, extract the src directory into your project folder and delete the now empty Sort_Algorithms-Analysis directory
4. If your IDE hasn't automatically changed its source to the src directory, manually change it in your settings. In IntelliJ, File>Project Structure>Modules, click on the src directory and select "Sources"
5. If the SDK hasn't been automatically changed, change it to Java 17. In IntelliJ, File>Project Structure>Project
6. Installation should be complete
## Usage

To use this code after installation, follow these steps:
1. Run 'FileCreation.java' to generate all necessary files
2. After all files have been generated, run 'Driver.java' to run tests
3. This will take a few minutes. After tests are finished, results are printed to 'Results.txt'
4. 'Results.txt' can be opened using Excel or another spreadsheet application to analyze the results further
